- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nina-An4
- 👀 I’m interested in designing a more connected future, and have founded a company to do just that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, mostly in the context of web development. Although my background is in business management, product design and strategy, I think it's important to understand the fundamentals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet people I can learn from and possibly collaborate with on future projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me - Email: contact@sloan-technologies.com
